# mazecast
In-terminal maze game using ncurses.

Largely inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw) from [javidx9](http://www.onelonecoder.com/index.html).

# install / run

```sh
sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev cmake
./build_and_run.sh
```

In case ncurses mess up your terminal, just type `reset`

# improvement suggestions

- a coloured minimap
- fix fish-eye effect
